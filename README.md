Based on deepmind research paper of the same name, this deep CNN model
generates audio of any type, music, speech, songs, with enough training.
The core power of the model is based on the dilated convolution stacks
which enables large receptive field by keeping the layers low.

This repo is an attempt for the implementation of the same. At the moment
it is not user friendly and is only meant for educational purpose.
